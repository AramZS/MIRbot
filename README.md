PHPIRCBot
=========

### Written by Xan Manning

This is a modular PHP bot that I wrote based upon Molobot by CodeDemons. It was created for personal uses but I am releasing it for others to play with. I haven't yet explained how modules work but I have included one module that I use on InspIRCd.

This has been released under the MIT License.
